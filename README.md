# Closest_distance_on_mesh
Choose one of subsample points as the start point, sequence subsample points on mesh


input: stl file(high-quality mesh, Openmesh structure)
       subsampled points(x,y,z)
       
output:distance[i][0] = distances(double)
       distance[i][1] = sequence number in subsampled points
